I'm originally from Italy. It is always fascinating to meet people and other cultures. I like the variety of the travelers. 
Hospitality is for me very important.
I'm interested in arts, architecture, theater, restaurants and in the wonderful world of children, which teaches us every day to see life from an other perspective.
When we go on vacation, we can offer our apartment. However, I'm open for exceptions of various kinds. Please contact me without hesitation.

I speak German, Spanish, Italian, English and French.

Ich interessiere mich für die Kunst, die Architektur, das Theater, die Gastronomie und zu guter Letzt für die wunderbare Kinderwelt, die uns soviel lehrt und mit anderen Augen sehen lässt. 
Wenn wir in die Ferien reisen, können wir Ihnen unsere Wohnung anbieten. Wir sind jedoch offen für Ausnahmen verschiedenster Art. Bitte kontaktiert mich ohne zu zögern.

ITALIANO:
Sono originaria dell'Italia. E 'sempre affascinante incontrare nuove persone e altre culture. Mi piace la vastità che i viaggiatori portano con se. Sono come dimensioni che si aprano e ci aiutano a percepire l'amplitudine di questo mondo.  L'ospitalità è fondamentale per me. 
Sono interessata all'arte, all'architettura, al teatro, alla gastronomia, ma la cosa più bella è che ci ritroviamo giorno dopo giorno ad imparare nuove lezioni sul mondo dei bambini, che ci insegna a vedere ed a percepire la vita da un'altra perspettiva. 
Quando andiamo in vacanze possiamo offrire il nostro appartamento. Ma siamo aperti per eccezioni di vario genere. 
Non esitate a mettervi in contatto con me.

Two rooms that I am listing are from a friend whose house was too empty after his wife died. Now the house is much livelier and he also seems much happier again. He thinks I should get something for making those contacts, even if I never expected it. Three listings are actually only one holiday house that we own, but during the Film Festival in Locarno I only rent two rooms and I make breakfast because then we always have very good conversations under the kaki tree. Our own accommodations are not so perfect and therefore I try to describe them very well, hoping that sophisticated people won't even consider staying with us.

Some Quotes:
""Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.""
- Albert Einstein

""Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding. You cannot subjugate a nation forcibly unless you wipe out every man, woman, and child. Unless you wish to use such drastic measures, you must find a way of settling your disputes without resort to arms."" 
- Albert Einstein

""All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.""
- Albert Einstein

""Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.""
- Albert Einstein

""We cannot expect to cross the rainbow bridge through a good act of contrition; that will not be sufficient. We have to understand."" - Terrence McKenna

""Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century, and more than anywhere else this illness is reflected in the press."" - Alexandr Solzhenitsyn

""My ultimate dream is to sow seeds in the desert. To revegetate the deserts is to sow seed in people's hearts."" - Masanobu Fukuoka

""Men tend to have the beliefs that suit their passions. Cruel men believe in a cruel God, and use their belief to excuse their cruelty. Only kindly men believe in a kindly God, and they would be kindly in any case."" - Bertrand Russell

""Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now."" - Viktor Frankl

""The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation; in fact, it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society — and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic. In the context of this study the crucial question is whether the hypothesis of a quasi-autistic or of low-grade schizophrenic disturbance would help us to explain some of the violence spreading today."" - Erich Fromm

""World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation."" - Marshall Mcluhan

""Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.""

Some Quotes:
""Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.""
- Albert Einstein

""Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding. You cannot subjugate a nation forcibly unless you wipe out every man, woman, and child. Unless you wish to use such drastic measures, you must find a way of settling your disputes without resort to arms."" 
- Albert Einstein

""All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.""
- Albert Einstein

""Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.""
- Albert Einstein

""We cannot expect to cross the rainbow bridge through a good act of contrition; that will not be sufficient. We have to understand."" - Terrence McKenna

""Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century, and more than anywhere else this illness is reflected in the press."" - Alexandr Solzhenitsyn

""My ultimate dream is to sow seeds in the desert. To revegetate the deserts is to sow seed in people's hearts."" - Masanobu Fukuoka

""Men tend to have the beliefs that suit their passions. Cruel men believe in a cruel God, and use their belief to excuse their cruelty. Only kindly men believe in a kindly God, and they would be kindly in any case."" - Bertrand Russell

""Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now."" - Viktor Frankl

""The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation; in fact, it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society — and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic. In the context of this study the crucial question is whether the hypothesis of a quasi-autistic or of low-grade schizophrenic disturbance would help us to explain some of the violence spreading today."" - Erich Fromm

""World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation."" - Marshall Mcluhan

""Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new."" 
- Bertrand Russell

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

If you make a reservation with me I will give you plenty of ideas about what to do in Zurich before you arrive and am also more than happy to tell you about some hidden spots and local specialties once we meet in person.

― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

A Swiss family of four (David, Michelle, Lee and Jim). 
We love our tiny apartment in the heart of Zurich, but also appreciate our mountain home in Laax a lot. 
When not working you can find us at a coffee shop, being active outside (we love sports). We are also interested in interior design and visiting other cities (such as Barçelona, which is one of our favorites). 

Our homes are kept minimalistic and eco friendly. 

David runs his own heating and sanitary company.
Michelle works part time as social media manager for a local coffee roastery, runs her own blog (since 2014) and keeps the boys busy and entertained.

""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

My husband and I own a film production company and work with our team from the villa. Our big passion is film, has been always and still fascinates us every day.

Since we acquired the villa a few years ago, another joy finds its way into our environment; I absolutely love to decorate and interior design spaces. In little steps we've been renovating the house, giving it back it's old beauty. Amazing how it's changing step by step. Sharing it with guests is great.

Die Maske muss immer die Nase und den Mund bedecken.

Darüber hinaus möchten wir Sie darauf hinweisen, dass sich stets nur die bei der Buchung angegebene Anzahl an Personen in den Hotelzimmern aufhalten darf. Der Aufenthalt von weiteren Personen, Besuch oder Ähnlichem ist nicht gestattet. Wir behalten uns vor, unser Hausrecht bei Zuwiderhandlung (notfalls polizeilich) geltend zu machen. Feiern, Partys oder ähnliche Ansammlungen in den Hotelzimmern sind strengstens verboten.

Diese kann bei Anreise in Form von Bargeld, EC- oder Kreditkarte hinterlegt werden. Eine Rückerstattung erfolgt unmittelbar nach Ihrer Abreise. Das Hotel kann zudem eine Kopie Ihres Ausweises anfertigen.

And here is 'my' & 'our' story...

My journey to real estate entrepreneurship

As a global IT professional,  I came to Switzerland in 2007 to work for one of the two largest Swiss banks. 

And then began the hassle and cumbersome process to look for a rental apartment in Switzerland, which fits your budget and proximity to your work location.

I decided to do something to ease the hassles of finding an apartment for Expats in Switzerland.

Way back in 2014, a French co-guest in a hotel in Davos, suggested me to by an apartment which I can afford, instead of waiting for a dream house to buy.

And so began my first real estate entrepreneurial venture, when I  bought and rented my first apartment in Glattbrugg, Zürich in October 2014. 

In last 8 years, 'I' became 'WE' and we are making news as being among the first choice for global IT professionals for short or long term stay in Switzerland.

All our apartments are fully furnished with 101 + Items.

We do also support tourists in Zürich, Bern, Basel, Luzern, Lauterbrunnen and Zug.

We take pride in keeping the Indian tradition of valuing our guests as ´God´ - अतिथि देवो भवः (Atithi Devo Bhava) as we say in Sanskrit. It is our endeavour  to offer you a truly  ‘home-away-from-home’ experience, a feeling as someone rightly said. 

“Home is not a place…it’s a feeling.”

We believe in the philosophy ´the world is one family - वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्  (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) and ´the global village´. 

It´s our  privilege and honor to welcome you from all over the world. I look forward to welcome you in our ´signature´ and beautifully done ´Swiss Home across Switzerland´.

You are welcome to choose from one of the  100 apartments all over Switzerland in all the different ´flavours´ - studio, sharing, holiday apartments, ladies only, sharing, full occupancy and even on daily and weekly basis.

We are the only one in Switzerland who gives you a ´home´. instead of an apartment and who connects you with ´community´ instead of just getting ´networked´ !

And we have a special offer for corporate travellers for long or short term stay in Switzerland and we provide invoices for all your stays.

Our beautifully done signature apartments all over Switzerland  ensure true feelings and warmth of ´home away´from home, a Swiss home with local ´flavour´!

Come, please enjoy our hospitality and spread the word around...

And here is 'my' & 'our' story...

My journey to real estate entrepreneurship

As a global IT professional,  I came to Switzerland in 2007 to work for one of the two largest Swiss banks. 

And then began the hassle and cumbersome process to look for a rental apartment in Switzerland, which fits your budget and proximity to your work location.

I decided to do something to ease the hassles of finding an apartment for Expats in Switzerland.

Way back in 2014, a French co-guest in a hotel in Davos, suggested me to by an apartment which I can afford, instead of waiting for a dream house to buy.

And so began my first real estate entrepreneurial venture, when I  bought and rented my first apartment in Glattbrugg, Zürich in October 2014. 

In last 8 years, 'I' became 'WE' and we are making news as being among the first choice for global IT professionals for short or long term stay in Switzerland.

All our apartments are fully furnished with 101 + Items.

We do also support tourists in Zürich, Bern, Basel, Luzern, Lauterbrunnen and Zug.

We take pride in keeping the Indian tradition of valuing our guests as ´God´ - अतिथि देवो भवः (Atithi Devo Bhava) as we say in Sanskrit. It is our endeavour  to offer you a truly  ‘home-away-from-home’ experience, a feeling as someone rightly said. 

“Home is not a place…it’s a feeling.”

We believe in the philosophy ´the world is one family - वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्  (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) and ´the global village´. 

It´s our  privilege and honor to welcome you from all over the world. I look forward to welcome you in our ´signature´ and beautifully done ´Swiss Home across Switzerland´.

You are welcome to choose from one of the  100 apartments all over Switzerland in all the different ´flavours´ - studio, sharing, holiday apartments, ladies only, sharing, full occupancy and even on daily and weekly basis.

We are the only one in Switzerland who gives you a ´home´. instead of an apartment and who connects you with ´community´ instead of just getting ´networked´ !

And we have a special offer for corporate travellers for long or short term stay in Switzerland and we provide invoices for all your stays.

Our beautifully done signature apartments all over Switzerland  ensure true feelings and warmth of ´home away´from home, a Swiss home with local ´flavour´!

Come, please enjoy our hospitality and spread the word around...

And here is 'my' & 'our' story...

My journey to real estate entrepreneurship

As a global IT professional,  I came to Switzerland in 2007 to work for one of the two largest Swiss banks. 

And then began the hassle and cumbersome process to look for a rental apartment in Switzerland, which fits your budget and proximity to your work location.

I decided to do something to ease the hassles of finding an apartment for Expats in Switzerland.

Way back in 2014, a French co-guest in a hotel in Davos, suggested me to by an apartment which I can afford, instead of waiting for a dream house to buy.

And so began my first real estate entrepreneurial venture, when I  bought and rented my first apartment in Glattbrugg, Zürich in October 2014. 

In last 8 years, 'I' became 'WE' and we are making news as being among the first choice for global IT professionals for short or long term stay in Switzerland.

All our apartments are fully furnished with 101 + Items.

We do also support tourists in Zürich, Bern, Basel, Luzern, Lauterbrunnen and Zug.

We take pride in keeping the Indian tradition of valuing our guests as ´God´ - अतिथि देवो भवः (Atithi Devo Bhava) as we say in Sanskrit. It is our endeavour  to offer you a truly  ‘home-away-from-home’ experience, a feeling as someone rightly said. 

“Home is not a place…it’s a feeling.”

We believe in the philosophy ´the world is one family - वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्  (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) and ´the global village´. 

It´s our  privilege and honor to welcome you from all over the world. I look forward to welcome you in our ´signature´ and beautifully done ´Swiss Home across Switzerland´.

I'm Swiss-Austrian and grew up in the Middle East. I'm in my thirties and love to travel, which I do as often possible. Staying at friends' and locals' homes makes a travel experience wonderfully rich and authentic. That's why my first trip with airbnb in 2012 got me hooked on the concept ever since.  

Travelling, I'm the outdoors and adventure type, food loving, culture curious, long time burner, etc.
At home, I love brunching with friends, persuing my spiritual practice, ice swimming in the lake, philosophising over theater and the world,  exploring flea markets and exhibitions and anything wonder related.

I wish for all of us to stay curious and keep discovering this vibrant world. Maybe meet you soon?
Great greetings,

herzlichen Dank für Ihr Interesse an unserem Unternehmen THE FLAG Zürich. Damit Sie sich auch in Zeiten von Corona sicher und wohl während Ihres Aufenthalts bei uns fühlen, möchten wir Ihnen im Folgenden einige Hinweise geben.
Wir möchten Sie darauf aufmerksam machen, dass aufgrund der aktuellen Coronapandemie in unserem Hotel eine strenge Maskenpflicht gilt. Bitte Tragen Sie eine Maske, sobald Sie Ihr Hotelzimmer verlassen und sich in öffentlichen Bereichen (Lobby, Flur, Aufzug, Tiefgarage etc.) aufhalten. Die Maske muss immer die Nase und den Mund bedecken.

Darüber hinaus möchten wir Sie darauf hinweisen, dass sich stets nur die bei der Buchung angegebene Anzahl an Personen in den Hotelzimmern aufhalten darf. Der Aufenthalt von weiteren Personen, Besuch oder Ähnlichem ist nicht gestattet. Wir behalten uns vor, unser Hausrecht bei Zuwiderhandlung (notfalls polizeilich) geltend zu machen. Feiern, Partys oder ähnliche Ansammlungen in den Hotelzimmern sind strengstens verboten. 

Sicherheitskaution:
Bei Check-In benötigen wir eine Garantie über die Summe Ihres Aufenthaltes sowie CHF 200.00 für mögliche Extras als Sicherheitskaution. Diese kann bei Anreise in Form von Bargeld, EC- oder Kreditkarte hinterlegt werden. Eine Rückerstattung erfolgt unmittelbar nach Ihrer Abreise. Das Hotel kann zudem eine Kopie Ihres Ausweises anfertigen.

Nichtraucherhotel:
Das Rauchen ist in all unseren Hotelzimmern sowie in den öffentlichen Bereichen von THE FLAG Zürich strengstens untersagt. THE FLAG ist ein reines Nichtraucherhotel. Bei Verstoß gegen das Rauchverbot behalten wir uns vor, die Reinigungskosten (bis zu CHF 500.00) in Rechnung zu stellen bzw. mit der Sicherheitskaution zu verrechnen. Das Rauchen ist nur auf Balkonen und Terrassen erlaubt.

Sachbeschädigung und Haftung:
Hotel- und Übernachtungsgäste haften für Schäden oder übermäßige Verschmutzung, welche sie am Eigentum von THE FLAG verursachen. Schadensersatzzahlungen werden mit der Sicherheitskaution verrechnet bzw. gesondert in Rechnung gestellt. 

Nachtruhe:
Zwischen 22.00 und 07.00 Uhr bitten wir Sie, die Nachtruhe zu respektieren und andere Gäste nicht zu stören. Personen, die gegen die Hausruhe verstoßen, kann ein weiterer Aufenthalt im THE FLAG Zürich verweigert werden. Ebenfalls kann ein Hausverbot ausgesprochen werden.


Zuwiderhandlungen gegen die vorgenannten Regeln werden mit bis zu CHF 500.00 geahndet.

Vielen Dank für die Beachtung der Regeln. Sollten Sie Fragen zu Ihrem Aufenthalt haben, stehen wir Ihnen jederzeit gerne zur Verfügung.

herzlichen Dank für Ihr Interesse an unserem Unternehmen THE FLAG Zürich. Damit Sie sich auch in Zeiten von Corona sicher und wohl während Ihres Aufenthalts bei uns fühlen, möchten wir Ihnen im Folgenden einige Hinweise geben.
Wir möchten Sie darauf aufmerksam machen, dass aufgrund der aktuellen Coronapandemie in unserem Hotel eine strenge Maskenpflicht gilt. Bitte Tragen Sie eine Maske, sobald Sie Ihr Hotelzimmer verlassen und sich in öffentlichen Bereichen (Lobby, Flur, Aufzug, Tiefgarage etc.) aufhalten. Die Maske muss immer die Nase und den Mund bedecken.

Darüber hinaus möchten wir Sie darauf hinweisen, dass sich stets nur die bei der Buchung angegebene Anzahl an Personen in den Hotelzimmern aufhalten darf. Der Aufenthalt von weiteren Personen, Besuch oder Ähnlichem ist nicht gestattet. Wir behalten uns vor, unser Hausrecht bei Zuwiderhandlung (notfalls polizeilich) geltend zu machen. Feiern, Partys oder ähnliche Ansammlungen in den Hotelzimmern sind strengstens verboten. 

Sicherheitskaution:
Bei Check-In benötigen wir eine Garantie über die Summe Ihres Aufenthaltes sowie CHF 200.00 für mögliche Extras als Sicherheitskaution. Diese kann bei Anreise in Form von Bargeld, EC- oder Kreditkarte hinterlegt werden. Eine Rückerstattung erfolgt unmittelbar nach Ihrer Abreise. Das Hotel kann zudem eine Kopie Ihres Ausweises anfertigen.

Nichtraucherhotel:
Das Rauchen ist in all unseren Hotelzimmern sowie in den öffentlichen Bereichen von THE FLAG Zürich strengstens untersagt. THE FLAG ist ein reines Nichtraucherhotel. Bei Verstoß gegen das Rauchverbot behalten wir uns vor, die Reinigungskosten (bis zu CHF 500.00) in Rechnung zu stellen bzw. mit der Sicherheitskaution zu verrechnen. Das Rauchen ist nur auf Balkonen und Terrassen erlaubt.

Sachbeschädigung und Haftung:
Hotel- und Übernachtungsgäste haften für Schäden oder übermäßige Verschmutzung, welche sie am Eigentum von THE FLAG verursachen. Schadensersatzzahlungen werden mit der Sicherheitskaution verrechnet bzw. gesondert in Rechnung gestellt. 

Nachtruhe:
Zwischen 22.00 und 07.00 Uhr bitten wir Sie, die Nachtruhe zu respektieren und andere Gäste nicht zu stören. Personen, die gegen die Hausruhe verstoßen, kann ein weiterer Aufenthalt im THE FLAG Zürich verweigert werden. Ebenfalls kann ein Hausverbot ausgesprochen werden.

French and US citizen, living in Switzerland. Now traveling a lot for business. I like to keep my apartment feeling very cosy with good energy. Most people feel immediately comfortable when walking in and everyone that has come to see my apartment has said it looks as nice as the pictures if not nicer. I have personally been disappointed on airbnb a couple times with listings that I rented that were nothing like the description or the pictures. 
I'm easy going and will do my best to make sure you feel at home as long as you are clean and treat my place like it was your own home, or better if your home is not so clean :) 
Have lived in Zurich for 12 years so I can definitely help with suggestions for most things and happy to help where I can.

Welcome on our profile!

We are a Ukrainian-French couple or as we prefer to call ourselves: a European couple. We have been living in 8 countries (62.5% of them together) and we combine the ability to speak 5.5 languages. 

We love travelling (very much), discovering places and discovering cultures. We are optimistic and curious people caring a lot about our friends and families.

Olena loves to eat (she is addicted to chocolate - and Switzerland is a risky place to be) and Thibaut has to pretend he knows how to cook because of his origins. =)

Among the things we love (combined): Great books, board games, classic slow rock, interesting people (95% of people according to our research), psychology, consumer behaviour, startups, management of innovation, brand's history of corporations, Mario Kart, Zelda, Crêpes (do not call them pancakes - EVER),... and thousands of other things.  

We look very much forward to meeting you!

I very much enjoy travelling and getting to know other cultures and its people. While seeing tourist attractions is definitely fun and interesting, I am also very enthusiastic about meeting locals. A good chat or a night out can be the most insightful thing;) 

I am very international myself. I am half-Thai, half-German born and raised in Bavaria (Würzburg). Having spent a high school year in the USA (Seattle), I chose to study at the international Jacobs University Bremen, where only a quarter of the students is German. I finished my BSc in Physics there and continued my studies at the ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Now I live between Zurich, working as an AI Consultant, and Bangkok, working as teacher for Data Science.

I am very open-minded and always up for a talk about pretty much anything, not only physics;) In my free time I enjoy sports in general but especially football, dancing and electronic music.

I'm Belinda - this is English because I believe it's probably the language most of us speak and understand. 

I was born and raised in Switzerland and have always loved to travel and meet new people all around the world. I have an open mind and heart. I'm always up for a good laugh, good music and some dancing. Life is short and precious, so let's try to make it as special as possible  :) 

Can't wait to meet YOU!
